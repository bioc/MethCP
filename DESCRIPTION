Title: Differential methylation anlsysis for bisulfite
        sequencing data
Version: 0.99.6
Author: Boying Gong
Maintainer: Boying Gong <jorothy_gong@berkeley.edu>
Description: methcp is a differentially methylated region 
    (DMR) detecting method for whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) 
    data, which is applicable for a wide range of experimental designs 
    beyond the two-group comparisons, such as time-course data. 
    methcp identifies DMRs based on change point detection, which 
    naturally segments the genome and provides region-level 
    differential analysis.
